- Python 3.5 (Recccomended) or higher.
- Requests module

to install a module type the following inside Windows Command Prompt:

- Steps:
 1. Open Cmd and change directories to the path of the program
     Ex: for me its "C:\Users\Austin\Desktop\ClanRaper420"

 2. Once in the correct directory type the program name in to launch it.
     Ex: <C:\Users\Austin\Desktop\ClanRaper420>bungie.exe"

 3. Now it will prompt you to type in a word list, you can either you the one provided (list.txt) or you can use your own.
    just type in your wordlist's file name.

 4. Next it will ask for the output file, just type in "output.txt"

 5. Finally, it will ask you for your browsers X-API-Key. If you don't know how to find it i'll tell the steps or you can google it.
    a. go to https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/MyClans and open Inspect Element. 
    b. then in inspect element click Network, then put in some random numbers into the clan search bar and click search. 
    c. you should see a new result in the network tab. click on it, scroll down until you see something called X-API-Key, then copy the string of numbers and letters and paste it in.

 6. Now you wait for the program to check the list fully. You're Done now :)
